Sabermetrics

I quote the definition from Wikipedia here:

    Sabermetrics is the analysis of baseball through objective evidence,
    especially baseball statistics.

I'm trying to provide an easy interface to access states of players and teams of a league.  With Sabermetrics.pm, you can either access the built-in league or feed your data to it easily, then compute whatever you want to know.

I'll be glad if you help me add more modules for more leagues.  You can refer to Baseball::Sabermetrics::League::*.
